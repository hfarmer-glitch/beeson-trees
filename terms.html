                <h2>2. Application of These Conditions</h2>
                <p>These Conditions apply to and form part of the Contract between the Contractor and the Client. They supersede any previously issued terms and conditions of purchase or supply.</p>
                <p>No terms or conditions endorsed on, delivered with, or contained in the Client's purchase conditions, order, confirmation of order, specification or other document shall form part of the Contract except to the extent that the Contractor otherwise agrees in writing.</p>
                <p>No variation of these Conditions or to an Order or to the Contract shall be binding unless expressly agreed in writing and executed by a duly authorised signatory on behalf of each of the Contractor and the Client respectively.</p>
                <p>Each Order by the Client to the Contractor shall be an offer to provide the Works subject to the Contract including these Conditions.</p>
                <p>If the Contractor is unable to accept an Order, it shall notify the Client as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
                <p>The offer constituted by an Order shall remain in effect and be capable of being accepted by the Contractor for 14 Business Days from the date on which the Client submitted the Order, after which time it shall automatically lapse and be withdrawn.</p>
                <p>The Contractor may accept or reject an Order at its discretion. An Order shall not be accepted, and no binding obligation to supply any Works shall arise, until the earlier of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the Contractor's written acceptance of the Order; or</li>
                    <li>the Contractor performing the Works or notifying the Client that they are ready to be performed (as the case may be).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rejection by the Contractor of an Order, including any communication that may accompany such rejection, shall not constitute a counter-offer capable of acceptance by the Client.</p>
                <p>The Contractor may issue quotations to the Client from time to time. Quotations are invitations to treat only. They are not an offer to supply Works and are incapable of being accepted by the Client.</p>
                <p>Marketing and other promotional material relating to the Works are illustrative only and do not form part of the Contract.</p>

                <h2>3. Quotations</h2>
                <p>All Quotations are valid for 30 calendar days only.</p>
                <p>VAT will be charged at the current rate (at the date of the beginning of the Works).</p>
                <p>All quotes are without obligation.</p>
                <p>Variation to the Quotations as a result of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Amendments to works required prior to arriving on-site; or</li>
                    <li>Changes in site / ground conditions since the original visit; and</li>
                    <li>Additional works requested / required whilst on site</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Quotation will be revised accordingly, either electronically in advance or in a hand written on the day of work, with agreed amendments signed by the Contractor and the Client.</p>
                <p>The work will commence on the agreed date, as specified in the quotation confirmation correspondence between the time of 10:00 and 17:00 unless otherwise stated.</p>
                <p>A 'Day' and/or 'Day Rate' for the purposes of the contract are either between 10:00 and 17:00 or between 9:00 and 16:00. A day is limited to only that Day in which the Day began. If the full Day is not used and work continues on the following Day there shall be no accumulation of time.</p>
                <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example 1: Work commences at 9:00 and finishes at 15:00 this shall constitute a single day.</li>
                    <li>Example 2: Work commences at 9:00 and finishes at 16:00 and the next calendar day work commences at 9:00 and concludes at 12:00 this shall constitute two Days.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unless expressly stated in the Quotation the works for which these terms apply will not include the cost of ensuring that there is no damage by way of turning and/or dents (this list being non-exhaustive) to the lawn/garden of the Property; in the event that you wish for us to ensure that dents/damage do not occur we are able to rig the descending parts of the tree to minimise damage at extra expense and/or board out the work area to minimise the risk of turning, please note that to do so will increase the time and cost of any works.</p>

                <h2>4. The Agreement</h2>
                <p>By accepting any quotations, either in writing or verbally, the Client enters into a contract with the Contractor to complete the agreed works and constitutes an Order.</p>
                <p>The Contractor commits to completing all works to British Standard 3998 and to also leave all work sites clean and tidy although given the nature of the work some damage, in some circumstances, may be inevitable and unavoidable.</p>
                <p>The Client accepts these terms and conditions by accepting a quotation and therefore commissioning works.</p>
                <p>Unless expressly stated in the quotation all logwood/brash/chippings or other detritus generated as a consequence or as part of the works these terms relate to will belong to and be the property of the Contractor.</p>

                <h2>5. Price and Payment</h2>
                <p>The price for the Services shall be as set out in the Quotation (the Price) and are subject to clause 3.</p>
                <p>The Contractor shall invoice the Client for the Services, partially or in full, at any time following acceptance of the Order.</p>
                <p>The Customer shall pay all invoices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>in full without deduction or set-off, in cleared funds on or before the Completion of Works; and</li>
                    <li>to the bank account nominated by the Contractor or in cash to the Contractor.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Time of payment is of the essence. Where sums due under these Conditions are not paid in full by the due date:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the Contractor may, without limiting its other rights, charge interest on such sums at 8% a year above the base rate of Bank of England from time to time in force;</li>
                    <li>interest shall accrue on a daily basis, and apply from the due date for payment until actual payment in full, whether before or after judgment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Payment must be made by bank transfer or via Cash on completion (on the day). In the event that the Client wishes to pay by cheque, a cheque for the full amount of the agreed works must be provided on the first day and the Client gives the Contractor unconditional authority to lodge said cheque with a bank of their choice at any point prior to or following completion of the works.</p>
                <p>The Customer may be liable for a surcharge for work conducted on weekends or a Public holiday. Surcharges are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saturday working will be 50% of the value of the Order; and</li>
                    <li>Sundays/bank holidays will be 100% of the value of the Order (this does not need to be reflected on the quotation).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Performance</h2>
                <p>The Services shall be performed by the Supplier at the Location on the date(s) specified in the Order.</p>
                <p>The Services shall be deemed performed on completion of the performance of the Services as specified in the Order.</p>
                <p>The Supplier may perform the Services in instalments. Any delay or defect in an instalment shall not entitle the Customer to cancel any other instalment.</p>
                <p>Time of performance of the Services is not of the essence. The Supplier shall use its reasonable endeavours to meet estimated dates for performance, but any such dates are indicative only.</p>
                <p>The Supplier shall not be liable for any delay in or failure of performance caused by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the Customer's failure to make the Location available;</li>
                    <li>the Customer's failure to prepare the Location as required for the performance of the Services;</li>
                    <li>the Customer's failure to provide the Supplier with adequate instructions for performance or otherwise relating to the Services;</li>
                    <li>Force Majeure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Cancellations and Alterations</h2>
                <p>In the event that an appointment must be cancelled, postponed or the specification of works changed, the Client must give 3 Calendar days' notice or be subject to a charge of 25% of the value of the works to be completed (unless otherwise stated).</p>
                <p>In the event that the Client cancels the Contract after the works have begun, the Client will be subject to a charge of 75% of the value of the works to be completed (unless more than 75% of the work has been completed, in the event of this the work will be billed proportionate to the Works completed).</p>
                <p>Once the Client has confirmed that they are satisfied with the works (per the quotation), the Contractor's obligations end.</p>
                <p>If the agreed works cannot be completed due to an unforeseen event outside the control of the Contractor, the Client will agree to postpone or annul the Contract.</p>
                <p>The Contractor reserves the right to cancel or postpone any works due to adverse weather conditions that would be deemed hazardous.</p>
                <p>If a quotation has been offered based on photos from the Client, the Contractor reserves the right to terminate the Contract if the photo is not representative of the tree or trees in question.</p>

                <h2>8. Liability</h2>
                <p>The Client is responsible for informing neighbours of proposed works to trees overhanging the Client's boundary and is responsible for any claims resulting from such works.</p>
                <p>The Client is responsible for ensuring that area 2 meters either side of the red line marked on the Work Plan is free from animal waste. In the event that such an area is not free from Animal Waste the Contractor at their sole discretion may charge a fee of £50.</p>
                <p>The Contractor is not responsible for any damage to underground Works and cables, unless discussed during quotation and the Client has provided a scaled underground plan of such Works.</p>
                <p>The Contractor requires that the work area is kept free from vehicles or other objects at all times and the client accepts all responsibility for the same.</p>
                <p>In the event that damage to property occurs through negligence or substandard practices by the Contractor, the Contractor will accept responsibility.</p>
                <p>The Contractor does not take responsibility for providing relevant parking permits for any controlled parking zones (unless expressly stated otherwise in the quotation), where a pay and display bay is not available within a suitable distance from work site. The Client is responsible for the cost of any parking fines where a parking permit is not provided and an alternative space is not available.</p>
                <p>The Contractor is not responsible for any damage to property that may arise from working in adverse weather conditions.</p>
                <p>The Client is responsible for informing the Contractor of any changes to the site from the time of quotation that may affect the planned processes. The Contractor reserves the right to amend or annul the contract as a result of site changes.</p>
                <p>The Contractor has the right to subcontract all or part of the commissioned works but will still be subject to these terms and conditions.</p>
                <p>The Client is responsible for providing copies of any permissions obtained by the Client relating to proposed works on restricted trees before the commencement of works.</p>
                <p>The Client is responsible for making arrangements with their tenants regarding providing access for the Contractor. If a tenant or third party is not available to provide access as and when agreed, the Client may incur a charge of 50% of the value of the proposed works.</p>
                <p>Where works are proposed to third party trees, i.e. 'neighbours trees', the Contractor will require written confirmation from the tree owner (the neighbours) that the works are agreed and where necessary, that access is permitted. If works only apply to overhanging branches that can be pruned from within the Client's property then permission is not required but the neighbour should be advised where practicable.</p>
                <p>If at the Client's request or by agreed works roots are poisoned, the Contractor will have no liability in respect of any damage caused to property, animals or possessions arising from this practice.</p>

                <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>The extent of the parties' liability under or in connection with the Contract (regardless of whether such liability arises in tort, contract or in any other way and whether or not caused by negligence or misrepresentation) shall be as set out in this clause 11.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The limitations of liability set out in clauses 11.2 to 11.4 shall not apply in respect of any indemnities given by the Customer under the Contract.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of the Contract, the liability of the parties shall not be limited in any way in respect of the following:</p>
                <ul>
